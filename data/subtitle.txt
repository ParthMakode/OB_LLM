 I gave a talk last night to a bunch of students at Clemson University and as often happens when you talk to a bunch of really sharp young people with good questions it spawned a lot of thoughts and and robust discussions and so what I wanted to do was share some of the insights from that conversation that I had and give you a little bit of updates in terms of uh kind of my current thinking on post- labor economics so the overarching questions that people ask are if we are heading for uh an AI Revolution a cognitive labor Revolution how is the economy going to work after everyone loses their jobs what industries Will Survive and which ones will collapse so we're going to unpack this from an individual level as well as an aggregate level looking at the economy as a whole so if you're new to this Channel or you're new to this concept post- labor economics is a new economic Paradigm that I personally predict is going to be coming where the the the very short version version is if you no longer need human labor what else changes if the combination of AI Quantum Computing robots and other automation replaces the need for human labor then obviously a lot of things change this means that we'll have to fundamentally renegotiate our relationship with labor with work with money with businesses and so on and so forth so uh as AI ramps up very quickly it's gaining new capabilities on a literally on a weekly basis sometimes on a da basis we are heading towards a hyper abundance of cognitive labor of knowledge work uh uh in the third Industrial Revolution we had a revolution of internet and computers so communication accelerated number crunching accelerated but by and large automation was still relegated to uh manufacturing processes now with this rise of uh artificial intelligence we're looking at a at what's called uh labor substitution ution in which case you have machines that are able to do new kinds of automation we're able to not just automate manufacturing jobs we're able to automate knowledge work and so this is going to drastically disrupt the employment landscape and of course the prevailing wisdom is that technology always creates new jobs this isn't necessarily true what technology does is it lowers costs which we will also talk about later in this video but when you lower costs that frees up capital and time and energy and money to be used elsewhere which then creates new sectors of Demands new uh total addressable markets which then translates to new jobs so there's actually several degrees of separation between Technologies and jobs growth However if those new markets are also addressable by the machines that we're building that's not necessarily going to translate to human jobs so with all that being said how is this going to work how is this going to look so what I'm going to present is not necessarily a complete picture because the idea of post- labor economics is still evolving um but I I think it is a worthwhile and and necessary conversation to have uh moving forward particularly as AI ramps up so primacia benefits just at first glance there's obviously a lot of benefits to having a ramp up of AI otherwise we wouldn't be doing it uh number one productivity surge if you have better machines more intelligent computers better language models uh and more an increasingly Advanced AI you get productivity benefits this has already been empirically proven where uh you know for instance Microsoft just had their ignite keynote speech where you know developers that use co-pilots are 55% more productive um in some cases depending on the task you can be 200% more productive and based on the work that I'm doing I think that before too long we're just going to replace replace human labor altogether in some domains and it's going to be just completely taken over by machines so an example an old school example of this is think about telephone operators telephone operators were entirely substituted by uh automatic uh telephone routing machines likewise I think that a lot of coding and a lot of other uh computer Centric jobs are going to be just fully automated away before too long and the speed of productivity is going to go up that's a good thing but it also has KnockOn effects and consequences scientific acceler ation so as I've as I've produced some tools in in the past about like you know reading and summarizing papers and now of course we have chatbots that have 100,000 token Windows um you can stuff a whole bunch of scientific papers into these um there's also better AI based tools to search for uh papers so pretty much every scientist that I've talked to is now using AI to accelerate their work now obviously it's not doing primary science on its own this is helping with things like uh literature reviews and then dra crafting manuscripts but still it's it's helping and then you look at the contribution that Labs such as deep mind are doing where they're actually creating fundamentally new Step changes in what is scientifically capable with tools like Alpha fold so if you're not familiar with Alpha fold this is a um this is a an AI model that allows you to accurately predict the ways that proteins will fold which has greatly accelerated uh drug Discovery and other kinds of biomedical research there's also uh you know creativity is is being dra ically impacted now we're just starting to see the first like full scale Productions of text to video and I I don't remember who but someone just predicted that the first 90-minute Hollywood feature film will be created within the next year and so that also has profound implications because if it becomes infinitely cheaper to make a Hollywood Blockbuster film that's going to disrupt Disney Hollywood Netflix uh it's going to disrupt you know the celebrity culture uh and and also just the way that we consume uh Digital entertainment so that is going to be profoundly disruptive but again on the surface it's a good thing because then it's like okay well we get more entertainment and it's cheaper and faster and more personalized we can also scale problem solving um basically you know if you've watched some of my recent videos about agents and agent swarms um once you can instantiate one good AI model you can instantiate billions of copies of that AI model that is that is cognitive labor that is scalable in a way that is not scalable with humans um and this is something that I talk about when I talk about like the automation Paradox is because until you get that final automation engine online nothing nothing really happens um but then so 0% of the work gets done until the very end and then it's done and then 100% of the work gets done very quickly and then of course this will also have knock on effects in terms like education and many other industries that we'll unpack later in this video one thing that I predict is going to happen is what I call price collapse so this is not rocket science but as we're already seeing uh for instance you know all the graphics in this in this uh slide deck were generated in a few seconds with AI so rather than paying a graphic designer hundreds if not thousands of dollars per video it literally cost me a few cents with Dolly and mid journey to make the graphics so that is a price collapse of a factor of hundreds if not tens of thousands of uh times cheaper and faster to do it you can expect the same kinds of price collapses for all kinds of services as I just mentioned once we nail text to video that means a 90-minute Hollywood Blockbuster instead of costing $100 million is going to cost $110,000 if that maybe less uh Legal Services uh Financial Services all kinds of things Medical Services Healthcare the KnockOn effects are very difficult to overstate um because we don't really have a mental model we don't have personal experience when entire uh job sectors and labor markets are drastically disrupted not by 10% or 50% but by 10,000% or a million per cheaper we just don't have a way of comprehending um the economic effects that that has now even in Industries where uh AI does not directly impact it so for instance AI can't necessarily make uh steel move faster in ships uh AI can't make trees grow faster however by removing human labor from from it um you can still drastically reduce the cost of primary goods and services like coal steel uh Timber uh Stone asphalt you know concrete those sorts of things and so even even then some of the costs can be reduced and avoided not 100% but we're going to have this really interesting economic Paradigm where some things primary resources like land are going to mostly hold their value but other goods and services are going to basically be free and this is why I think that uh billionaires like Bill Gates are buying up Forest land and farmland because they're reading the writing on the wall saying don't invest in financial Industries don't invest in healthcare don't invest in you know X Y and Z instead invest in you know things that are going to stick around and I'll talk about industries that I predict are going to stick around now one thing I need to caution is this is not this is not investing advice this is not Financial advice this is just me reading the te leaves um in what I see and my interpretation of the investing behavior of others in no in no means is this a uh recommendation um because I could be completely and fundamentally wrong about all of this uh so you have been you have been thoroughly warned another component of this whole trend is reduced aggregate demand so one of the students that I gave the talk to asked a really phenomenal question about if for instance we all start losing our jobs then we the consumers have less money and in aggregate we will have less demand so this is going to impact what businesses actually produce CU if we have less demand businesses are going to be less incentivized to produce goods and services for us because well you don't try and sell something to people that don't have money um and so this is actually one of the biggest uh questions that I see all the time on the comments as well is if we don't have money to spend how is the economy going to work so I'm not going to fully address this in this video but uh citizens civilians we're not the only consumer there's also businesso business transactions as well as business to government transactions which I think the the bulk of the economy is going to shift to being B2B and b2g or you know uh public sector uh expenditures now there all are also some primary demands that all civilians have and we'll talk about that in just a second but I did need to address that reduced aggregate demand is probably one of the biggest risk factors that we'll see in terms of the economy stalling if and when we see unemployment rates Rising sharply because again you know if you go from a sixf figure job or even a $50,000 job and you end up uh stuck on unemployment benefits or Universal basic income and your income is reduced to 20,000 a year um that is you have you know uh substantially Less Market power uh purchasing power in uh in the economy as an actor and so this is really going to fundamentally disrupt the economy again it remains to be seen if this happens but there has been some recent reports um very alarming reports showing that uh AI such as chat GPT are already disrupting a very broad spectrum uh of Industries and some in very unexpected ways so I've told this story before but uh one of my clients one of my former clients um told me a story where once the data an Analytics tool came out with chat GPT it replaced an entire uh bio bioinformatic statistician which that's a job that you need a master's degree or PhD to do and so then suddenly um you know this tool that costs $20 a month uh dislocates a job a human paying job that would have cost $88,000 a month or more to have a human in that role so that is that is the magnitude of reduced aggregate demand that we're looking for or that we're looking at happening now there is another component of this um which is uh primary primary needs which we'll talk about in just a moment so what this is all leading to is uh fundamentally New Market paradigms and so this Paradigm Shift um this this slide is more about some predictions that I have so for instance if we have robots if we have ai uh then perhaps as we're kind of moving towards a you know de globalization and there's Trends such as circular economies and farm to table I wonder if we're going to see the same thing with uh manufacturing of goods and also providing of services because if you can just provide goods and services on demand locally rather than having long logistic chains um so for instance imagine that your theater is running a local version that it just generated in the cloud rather than waiting for Hollywood um likewise imagine that you go to the Amazon store and instead of some Goods that are manufactured in China it's just 3D printed in the back so this is a little bit more speculative um but you know we already have some fictional examples of this like the replicators and Star Trek uh it's within the realm of possibilities but I think more eminently what we'll see is on demand production of digital goods and digital services such as Legal Services entertainment music that sort of thing that stuff is already in the pipeline uh local manufacturing of of physical Goods that may or may not happen but I just wanted to point out that we are looking at some of these kinds of shifts um now one thing that could happen is that uh as the economic landscape changes we could see what's called industry narrowing which is that uh many many companies and many uh job sectors or or market segments might just go away for good because they're made completely irrelevant those business models are made completely obsolete um so time will tell but it has happened before um an example is you don't really have horse breeders as a major uh economic thing anymore why because horses as an entire industry were replaced by automobiles over a century ago and so while horse care and horse breeding and carriage building and all that fun stuff was a major industry um because horses were used for everything draft horses were used on farms they were used for moving goods and services and moving people now that's no longer a thing and so we've seen it before we will see it again but it's difficult to predict exactly which Industries will fully collapse um and be kind of relegated to a luxury service because there are still horse breeders but this is more of a old money kind of stuff so what are the industries that will survive um just off the cuff here's kind of what I brainstormed as the industries that I think will probably stick around and be and be relatively durable again this is not investing advice uh personally I am not invested in any of these so take everything that I'm saying here with a gigantic grain of salt but first and foremost raw materials and energy we're going to need steel we're going to need concrete and stone we're going to need Timber we're going to need water right you know those kinds of things are based on primary needs so that is something that if you're if you're a living breathing human being you need food you need shelter you need clothes so some of those things are going the the demand for those is going to be persistent even if it's fully automated even if it is done by machines and robots and AI um semiconductors obviously if everything is running on AI we're going to need chip Fabs we're going to need memory CPUs gpus Ram servers supercomputers that industry is sticking around if anything it's going to be bigger it might be the primary industry honestly um because I also predict that in the long run it's just more economically feasible for open source data and open source models I just watched the entire Microsoft ignite keynote speech Microsoft is going all in on Clos Source models like gp4 they're also going all in on open source models so they are hedging their bets whatever however it panss out Microsoft and Nvidia it's all going to be running on their hardware and their Cloud platforms whether or not it's produced by open AI whether or not it's produced by meta or whether it's not it's produced by Carnegie melon or whoever else uh Robotics and automation if you build the tools that build the tools you're you're you're you're set so there's a meme that goes around that says during a gold rush sell pickaxes so the ones that sell the pickaxes the ones that sell the robots um that do everything else the ones that sell the automation hardware and software that do everything else they're going to be fine uh sustainable Tech so this is going to have to do with uh water agriculture sustainable farming solar energy other Renewables um whether it's thorium reactors or you know molten salt or nuclear Fusion whatever those things again because because energy is a primary need um I and as well as food I think that those Industries are going to stick around which again is why I think people like Bill Gates are investing in farmland and Timberland makes sense to me if I were in their shoes I do the same exact thing and then finally experience Industries so as we all transition away from uh working you know the 9 to-5 grind um which I can say from personal experience yeah like you get rid of the desk job you you get bored and you want stuff to do so that means movie theaters that means restaurants that means yoga studios that means Retreats um vacations airbnbs all kinds of everything around the experience industry I think is going to be a major major pillar of uh of the economy moving forward but again it's going to be interesting because technically film and TV are part of the experience industry but the models the the the cloud providers that build the models that write the new TV shows and movies those are going going to be the ones that stick around Netflix if they don't pivot they're not going to stick around Disney if they don't pivot they're not going to stick around now I did look it up before I made this video uh Disney did actually assemble like a strike force an AI strike force that they're they're actively exploring every way that they can incorporate AI into into their business so I think Disney is probably well positioned to stick around um and and you know they're already using AI for their animatronics they're already using AI to help with drafting um movies uh maybe they should used AI for Ant-Man Quantum Mania or maybe they did use Ai and that was the problem I don't know so what are the industries that I predict are going to go extinct um First Healthcare I've mentioned this before where when you combine regenerative medicine Rejuvenation therapies um and all the all the advancements that we're going to see from alpha fold 2 Alpha fold 3 and everything else I suspect that our relationship with Healthcare is going to be fundamentally and drastically different uh within 5 to 10 years a lot of people still ask me like Dave when are we going a hit longevity escape velocity last year there were three Rejuvenation Therapies in the pipeline this year there are 20 um the economic incentive to to uh to nail Rejuvenation therapies is so high um and it it's getting investment from everyone from DARPA to like allive Silicon Valley Google has you know alphabet has their their Rejuvenation their regeneration therapy Wing um so it's coming the the money is there where the money go results follow the same thing has happened with solar the same thing has happened with AI so the money is there it's just a matter of time I remember you know back in 2010 when I first started paying attention to solar and I'm like oh the it's ramping up and now a lot of Nations and a lot of companies are exceeding their you know carbon neutral targets obviously that's a contentious uh field so I'm not going to get too bogged down to into it but the point being is that back in 2010 nobody nobody thought that like solar would be where it is today and now it is likewise the investment is ramping up in regenerative uh medicine so it's coming down the pipeline education is going to is also going to fundamentally change um you know a lot of us are already using chat GPT and other tools to learn as fast as we can um I've actually consulted with a bunch of different startups that are trying to do um either tools for teachers tools for universities or avatars to to teach uh students you know if you ever watch Star Trek Voyager you know you go to the Hol and you have like a personalized Hol program with VR that's entirely possible that you're going to have you know students have one-on-one mentoring sessions with holographic avatars that would be really cool so uh University Systems are currently uh deeply strained um and if if uh jobs are going away then you're not going to be going to University to get a better job so then why would you go to university that's a conversation for another time but that is something that that some of the students at Clemson asked um and my my short answer was uh University experience is good if you're going to become a global Citizen and you still have a Monumental task before you in helping uh helping the human species become a truly Global species and a global culture because we are not right now we are very very fragmented uh Financial automation uh now obviously Wall Street and the finance industry and the investment industry that's not going away um but insurance and a bunch of other things I honestly suspect that the margins are going to get too thin on a lot of these industries and and it's going to be radically restructured and then finally as I've been talking about uh I do think that our relationship with uh Digital entertainment is going to fundamentally shift and I think we're going to see a lot of implosions and a lot of collapses because again if you need to pay an aess celebrity $20 million to make a movie or you could make 200 movies uh with AI for the same price you might guess which one you're probably going to do just for the sake of of economics uh real quick plug for my patreon um I have an upcoming webinar master class on December 8th at 11:00 a.m. us Eastern uh there's I have two tiers on my patreon there's the $5 basic tier which gets you access to Discord and then the $50 premium tier which gets you access to a bunch more uh exclusive content um but yeah so go ahead and sign up if you're interested and moving right back along into the show so I mentioned primary needs so this is a first principal view of what is it that people need because there are 8 billion people on the planet and even if money goes away tomorrow even if you know everything is fully automated this is an attempt to take a first principal view of okay what is it that people actually need because where there's a need there's a way there's if there's a if there's the biological the animal impetus to achieve these things we will figure it out so you know I've got a little infographic so there's food there's housing there's water there's energy um so those are all primary needs and I think that as the economy pivots those Industries as I mentioned are going to be the ones that are the most durable power generation food preparation production and movement um homes that sort of thing this is this is why for instance um many people have said like you know the Housing Industry is the safest investment because everyone needs somewhere to live likewise food is something that everyone needs but the margins are already really thin on food but so this I think is going to be like focusing on a primary needs uh uh economic Paradigm is going to be the first phase of the pivot to post labor economics because uh people have talked about like Universal basic income or Universal basic Services if we see a commensurate uh price collapse it's entirely possible that uh electricity will basically become free you know at least at the the scale that most people consume it at you know like my power bill that I just paid was $180 what if that goes down to $18 a month because of hyper abundance of solar and other Renewables what if uh water becomes practically free um you know clean uh healthy water because of energy hyper abundance what if all the KnockOn effects of AI and automation makes houses cheaper because the price of Timber goes down and the price of concrete goes down and also then the cost of building houses goes down because then you can do it with robots so again I think that I I it is not outside the realm of possibility that the cost of living um within the next 5 to 10 years could go down by as much as like 10x so like you know if your cost of living right now is $40,000 a year you might be able to have the same standard of living with $4,000 a year in 10 years that's kind of what I'm hoping for because that that uh that price collapse will offset the reduced aggregate demand because yes people might have less money but if everything is that much cheaper or even even you know more like let's say prices go down 100x but your your income goes down 10x you're effectively 10 times wealthier than you were before so obviously if all you have in life is just housing and food and clothes that's relatively boring so I then took a look at secondary needs so secondary needs are the spice of life this is the stuff that makes life interesting and fun and engaging and so the categories that I came up with were Rich experiences so like travel vacations uh Peak experiences like concerts and you know dance clubs and that sort of stuff those are going to be uh something that is very persistent there's going to be a durable demand for that uh creativity and expression so again as you have more time and you get away from you know the office job I and many people like me are engaging more and more in Creative Pursuits um I'm writing a novel I know lots of people that as soon as they retire they go back to acting and singing and that sort of thing I know plenty of people who are painters and digital artists um and so the industries around those even if if those are cottage industries and they're not primary economic uh drivers the persistent demand for human creativity and artistic expression uh is going to be around as long as there are humans um intellectual stimulation so there are many of those many of us who just want challenges for the sake of challenges so even if AI can do everything uh you know people are still going to play chess again machines are already better than humans at chess we still play chess people are still going to be programming and coding and doing hackathons yes even if the can do it better you still want to see you want to test your medal against uh the machine so reading for pleasure um those kinds of things obviously not everyone is a nerd like me so not everyone is like you know what if I don't have to use my brain I'm not goingon to I'm just going to go to the beach that's perfectly fine too culture and Community is another aspect that I think is going to stick around um and actually probably be magnified so what I mean is walkable cities green spaces Parks uh co-living and co-housing situations um community centers uh religious uh experiences whether churches you know there's a lot of talk around the future of ideology like is Christianity growing or going away there's geopolitical tensions between you know for instance Christianity and Islam but there's also a Resurgence of neopaganism uh you know witches are all the rage right now um so that sort of thing but then also you know there still talk about the meaning crisis and that sort of thing and so people are you know kind of desperate for that meaning and that connection particularly when you think about the fact that we're in the middle of a loneliness epidemic so the need for culture community and spirituality and connection are also going to be persistent and those are presently underserved needs I've been a big fan of the book the status game by William store and so one thing that I realized is one question that I get is okay well if you if you can't if you can't make money and therefore you can't uh you know build up your social status through conspicuous consumption what do we do um well there's lots of other ways to build up status you can get famous on YouTube you can um you know go to the gym and get a sexy body you can become a chess Grandmaster there's all kinds of things that you can do you can become a musician um social status throughout history has been largely predicated on other things other than wealth uh wealth as a social status is a relatively new uh phenomenon uh particularly under capitalism and neoliberalism where you incentivize people to accumulate more wealth because against conspicuous consumption is one of the best ways to Signal status but there are plenty of other ways to Signal status uh through education py spirituality um intellectual Pursuits physical Pursuits like athleticism um again like that's why I picked this image of a bunch of you know attractive young people laying on the beach why because part of what's happening in this image is status they're signaling their status by literally showing off their bodies um is that's one thing that people do and and if you ever go to the gym there are people that do that boys and girls men and women will show off their bodies at the gym and that's part of why they're doing it is because it makes them feel good they go to the gym and they're like I'm shredded I look really good um so anyways I do suspect that that as people come to understand this that a status economy is going to replace the attention economy um and we already see this like you know uh YouTubers and other influencers that have more subscribers they're like ah well I've got you know five times the subscribers that you do so therefore I'm better so like it's a popularity contest but that is a proxy for the STA contest now this is the biggest thing that scares me is uh and and this is what I actually am really interested in talking to more people about is forming a new social contract so the current social contract is around uh a three-way relationship between the government so we got Uncle Sam here and then we got the corporate fat cats and then we've got Ordinary People um so right now Uncle Sam the government mediates the relationship between the businesses and and the people the Labor uh Workforce but if the demand for labor goes away then suddenly the government and businesses are holding all the cards and that's a Surefire way to get a dystopian hellscape so how do we do that how do we navigate and fix it first we need to rebalance power um this means that we need to shift the priority away from businesses and more towards uh people and government uh particularly voter power and we'll do this through through um through Shoring up Democratic institutions such as voter reforms increasing Civic engagement adding new levers of power that that human or not humans but well all humans but that citizens have in terms of steering the government and ensuring that the government serves uh the people as much if not more than businesses we'll need some sort of redistribution mechanisms and honestly having some sort of redistribution behooves the the businesses because again if consumer if aggregate consumer demand goes down that's bad for business right if your if your customers are all broke that's no good so we'll need to make sure that consumers have money to spend in order to keep the economy going and pretty much you know some sort of redistribution whether it's negative income tax or Ubi or Universal basic basic Services we'll need something um the way that I the way that I articulated it mathematically is if if wealth and income in equality gradients are too steep then you can't go uphill you can't go uphill forever and this will also require some kind of regulatory overhaul now there are a lot of tools in the toolbox um in terms of fiscal policy and monetary policy that are already available so what I suspect is going to happen is that the establishment is going to do very small incremental changes across the board it's not going to be one big policy it's going to be um dozens if not hundreds of little incremental policy changes on a weekly monthly quarterly annual basis um to to adjust uh slowly cuz again law of unintended consequences if you change too many things at once you might end up uh making things worse uh which would be bad so just as a recap on this whole thing um we're talking at the at the highest level about knowledge L labor substitution the four criteria that I give is better faster cheaper safer as machines and AI become better faster cheaper and safer than humans at knowledge work um one there's no economic incentive to keep humans in those jobs um but then it it could also be considered unethical to keep humans in those jobs so for instance if a if an AI doctor is better faster cheaper and safer than a human Doctor Who are you going to go to you're going to go to the robot doctor because the outcomes are going to be better and it's going to be cheaper um and in that scenario it might become unethical to allow humans to continue practicing medicine uh likewise for driving once we stick the landing on full self-driving and you know let's say let's say that you know uh automatic cars can drive 10 billion miles uh you know per F fatality or less it would be it would might become illegal to allow humans to continue driving except in certain circumstances so that's one thing to keep in mind uh reduced aggregate demand is one going to be one of the major uh economic signals that we're going to be afraid of because if if aggregate consumer demand goes down the economy falters so on and so forth so we'll need something to Shore that up now again the the converse of that is price collapse might kind of offset that so but that's two very powerful deflationary pressures which we should expect to see some deflationary pressure because that's what technology does it makes goods and services cheaper um but I don't think we're ready for how much cheaper some of those goods and services are going to be so then I talked about primary needs which is just first first principle look at yourself as an animal what is it that you need and what are you willing to work or fight or whatever to get that's food water clothing housing you know your basic fundamental needs status economy is going to be a big component of uh how this all shakes out in terms of our social living um how we live on a day-to-day basis some of these things like some of the goods and services that stick around will be about status but when I talk about status economy I'm talking more about actually how we allocate our our personal time and resources we might spend more time at the gym we might spend more time practicing piano like that sort of stuff and I'm talking about myself here like I was just like I used to play piano as a kid you know what it might be time for me to pick that up again why cuz I enjoyed it and I was pretty good at it I've completely forgotten at all cuz it was you know I'm not going to say how long ago it was it was a long time ago um new social contract so negotiating a new social contract honestly changing the narratives around money and around democracy is probably the hardest part of all this because as I said we've got lots of we got lots of tools in the in the financial toolbox in terms of monetary policy and fiscal policy however in America our narratives around the ownership class around wealth around privilege around the elites that is probably going to be the biggest sticking point honestly because a lot of people are temporarily embarrassed Millionaires and so they're like oh well protect the millionaire class protect the corporate class at all costs and it's like they don't need any protection they're fine uh so we need to change the focus from the engines of productivity to us and I'm not talking about radically restructuring the entire economy um but you know we need to change something um and then finally as I already mentioned deflationary pressures so I don't need to rehash that thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this video like subscribe so on and so forth I'll see you next time cheers
