So today we 're making mushrooms specifically we 're boiling our mushrooms a lot of us have been told that when you process your mushrooms when you cook them they are not allowed to touch a single drop of water but in my experience I found that not to be correct and so today we 're going to explain why it works to boil your mushrooms today we 're cooking with three types of mushrooms the shitake the portabello and the oyster these are shitake mushrooms which is the Japanese word for them they are however um Chinese in origin I like to take off the tough part at the end but this stem is totally edible and I would throw that into the mix also if anything gives you a little bit of textural contrast so mushrooms because of their cell structure and the way this fungus is set up in between all these fibers is are big air pockets that are filled with air and eventually with what whatever liquid that it comes into contact with that 's a lot of the reason why some people say do n't soak them in water but if you were to throw a dry mushroom that is filled with all these Pockets like a sponge into a pan with hot oil that oil is just going to get absorbed almost entirely so you add a little bit more oil you keep adding oil and you keep adding oil just to prevent it from sticking what ends up happening is these mushroom sponges soak up all of that oil and then you get sort of a bit of a greasy mess so what we 're doing here is actually a bit of a reverse of that but we 're first going to be boiling it to saturate these mushrooms with water so that that sponge is filled to the brim and then we 're going to introduce oil and the good thing about oil at the end just a little bit is to help it brown the second is a Portell which is very steak like it 's very robust in flavor a lot more earthier some people actually uh my parents for example find Porter bells to be a little bit too aggressive I 'm going to cut this one into nines they do leak a lot of a dark brown liquid and have that earthiness so when they 're complemented with shitake which are somewhere in between and oyster mushrooms that are a little bit lighter and sweeter it 's going to create a nice uh fungus mix and then the oysters when they come in just peel them into sizable shapes if they 're a little bit too big just break them up the natural Contours and lines of the fibers of the mushroom will create nice Jagged edges for that caramelization to happen mix those up and this is our mix of mushrooms that we will cook in
