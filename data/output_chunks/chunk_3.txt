with sort of a delicious brine this is going to go for a little while so we 're going to hang out here in the Test Kitchen see what everybody else is up to what are you doing what are you doing Nick I 'm the old Chinese Uncle walking around with my hands behind my back Chopsticks in my pocket just like taking people 's stuff you know what we should we should do is we should get a drink yes surprise right are you making me a cocktail oh absolutely you what you feeling like um this is Harbor our cocktail resident yesterday I had a delicious Martini that had pickled mushrooms in it yeah yeah you want one of those yeah please dude it 's so sophisticated it 's so complicated it 's like a little soupy because of the mushroom in a good way we 'll be drinking a bunch of these tonight after the mushrooms yeah wait we need to check if the the the mushrooms are cooked subtle changes we are halfway through the cook maybe 7 or 8 minutes you 'll see that a broth has been built of all of the mushrooms that are cooking inside but also you 'll notice that this liquid is a little bit thick that starch that comes out of the mushroom that we 're coaxing out with the Heat and the boiling it 's not just water now it 's like becoming a broth it 's got texture which is a good thing if you pick up the shitake mushrooms they have have shrunk maybe about I 'm going to say halfway maybe a little bit less than it 2/3 now we 're going to keep an eye out on this cuz when it gets to the bottom you really do n't want it to burn all of that nutrient-dense flavor dense liquid is coming out of that mushroom coed by heat and water and you 're going to get a delicious product all we 're doing here is capitalizing on the deliciousness that 's already in the mushrooms and trying to amplify them but not adding too much but also by not taking anything away it 's like the essence of the mushroom I have maybe here about 1/4 cup of liquid left it 's really quite condensed we 're going to take it all the way down I 'm still maintaining a pretty high heat medium high because it 's a walk nothing is sticking but be patient and watch out at this stage we 're going to wait for basically all of that water to disappear we will have a very small window when the mushrooms are still saturated with liquid for us to add oil before it burned because it still has a little bit of liquid in there after that oil goes in it 's going to start to sizzle and build that nice caramelized crust that we 've been missing
