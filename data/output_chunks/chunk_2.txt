that walk two aromatics today first is the scallion and second is the Garlic unlike most of our stir fries we 're not going to start our cook with our aromatics and they 're only going to be tossed in at the end which means that their cooking time is going to be relatively short which means that I want to cut this garlic and this scallion a little bit thinner U because it does n't get to cook for as long it does get tossed on at the end and you will be able to see it so try to keep it nice so we 're washing these mushrooms with water which is so sacrilegious to very many people who went to culinary school first of all I did not go to culinary school and second of all I am not a western chef so I do n't know about those rules but we 're just going to be washing them just like this but we 're washing them we 're not killing them we 're not squeezing them we 're just using water to help us get into all those gills and places that are hard to get into I 'm going to drain this off okay let 's start cooking these mushrooms it 's a very straightforward cooking process in the walk mushrooms or Skillet whatever you have lying around and then we 're going to cover these mushrooms with water and then we 're going to turn it on I like using a walk for this recipe but a skillet works as well what I like about the walk is its shape so you do n't have to give that much liquid it also has a large surface area so that water can evaporate which is something that needs to happen cuz this liquid is going to be reduced and finally the walk itself is non-stick which means that as these mushrooms get to the bottom of the pan it wo n't stick stick and burn basically so the process is simple all you 're doing covering your mushrooms with water bringing it to a boil and letting it cook at least 15 minutes until all of that water has evaporated and disappeared oh shoot I forgot as this Cooks feel free to season your mushrooms I 'm using kosher here so I 'm being a little bit generous keep in mind all that water is going to be gone so do n't add too much one of the benefits of this cooking technique is we can season our mushrooms nice and early part of the problem with just searing them in oil is if you add salt a little bit too early the salt will start to draw a lot of moisture out of that mushroom making it difficult to build a sear that 's not the case here because we have plenty of time for these mushrooms to absorb that salt and get saturated
